# IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis
This project applies sentiment analysis techniques to the IMDb movie reviews dataset using both traditional and transformer-based NLP approaches. It combines the lexicon-based VADER model for quick polarity scoring with the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment model from Hugging Face Transformers to capture deeper contextual sentiment. The analysis includes text preprocessing, model inference, and visualization of sentiment distributions using tools like Torch, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The results compare rule-based and deep learning methods, highlighting the strengths and trade-offs of each approach when analyzing large-scale textual data.
